====================
Create a collaborative e-Science journal entry system for schoolchildren carrying out science 
projects. This system aims to support journal entries from groups of schoolchildren 
attempting to complete a collaborative science project. The system must be capable of 
registering the students names and details and then forming the students into groups and 
projects. The system will then permit students part-taking in a science project to make journal 
entries that are time-stamped for the duration of a project.
